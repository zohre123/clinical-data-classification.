Clinical and biological data classification has applications in several areas such as the diagnosis, estimation and prognosis of diseases. It is one of the most challenging problems in the field of machine learning, and one of the most critical problems in medicine.
In order to address this issue,  we propose a new method based on a combination of an ANN and the WCC algorithm in order to classify a clinical dataset.
