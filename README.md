# Tutorial for clinical data classification


Tutorial for clinical data classification. Zohre arabi bulaghi, Ahmad Habibi Zad navin ,  Mehdi Hsseinzadeh , Ali Rezaeea. Department  of  computer engineering Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad university, Tehran, Iran.  clinical data set classification an application for feature selection based on machine learning methods, it can be applied on problems needing to select subset of features from given feature disease set. In continue, we describe some aspects of clinical data classification .


# Implemented language

MATLAB programing language is used for implementing of clinical data classification. There are some reasons for using it:


1-Because MATLAB is common programing language in different sciences, classification has been implemented in t.
classification can be applied on various areas such as biological data, image processing, handwrite detection,computer science and many other fields.

2-MATLAB is supported by various operating systems such as win, linux, mac.

3-MATLAB is an open source programing language, so everyone can add some new capabilities on clinical data classification.
After investigating new capabilities, we will publish new version of clinical data classification at:
https://github.com/yms3786/featureselect.git.
          


# Installation

In order to install FEATURESELECT, you must provide some requirements:

1-Install WINSDK.1 in windws or MinGW in linux that include C++ compiler
2-Install MATLAB


After installing the requirements, follow these stages:
1-Copy all files placed in FEATURESELECT folder on the one of the available directories.
2-Go to \clinicaldataclassification\matlab\ in the intended directory.
3-Click on the one of the matlab files which is available in the entered directory. Notice that the matlab path and the current directory path must be the same.
4-If your application is not working for SVM, write "make" in the matlab's command window and press enter. Be sure that the command successfully completed.
